corsairs
========

Open-source roguelike/rpg/strategy game

You will need to get XNA - I suggest the [Windows Phone 7.1 SDK](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk), which provides everything you need to build.

To see it in action all you need to do is open the corsairs.xna solution, set corsairs.xna as your startup project and F5 away.
