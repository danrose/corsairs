corsairs
========

Open-source roguelike/rpg/strategy game. Makes use of terrain generation algorithms (diamond-square, cellular automata, erosion, biome classification) 
to create a different random world every time you play. Supports saving the current world to a file in order to let you come back later if you get
interrupted.

You will need to get XNA - I suggest the [Windows Phone 7.1 SDK](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk), which provides everything you need to build.

To see it in action all you need to do is open the corsairs.xna solution, set corsairs.xna as your startup project and F5 away.
